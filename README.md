# Projects

## Machine Learning Therapist 
This script implements a machine learning-based hate speech detection system that loads JSON data containing text messages and their severity classifications, then automatically trains and compares multiple classifiers (XGBoost, SVM, and Logistic Regression) to identify the best-performing model for categorizing messages into four severity levels (Safe, Medium, High, Extreme) with corresponding actions (allow, flag, review, block). The system uses TF-IDF vectorization with n-grams for feature extraction, includes a keyword-based severity boosting mechanism for extreme terms, balances training data to prevent bias, and provides confidence scores and recommended moderation actions for each analyzed message, making it suitable for automated content moderation applications.

## Financial Predictor

This project comprises a series of scripts intended to replicate and evaluate stock market order book data for the purpose of strategy creation.It downloads  market data from Kaggle and processes it through four interconnected components: a data loader that cleanses and organizes order book information while handling errors, a backtesting engine that analyzes buying versus selling pressure at market snapshots to generate trading signals (GO LONG, GO SHORT, or NEUTRAL), a feature extraction module that calculates key market indicators like bid-ask spreads, VWAP, order book imbalance and depth, and an order matching system that simulates trade execution by prioritizing orders and matching them when bid prices meet or exceed ask prices using heap-based algorithms.

## Project: Linear Regression: From First Principles to Practical Application

This project demonstrates a thorough understanding of linear regression by implementing it in two ways. First, a manual model is built from scratch using numpy to solve the least squares problem, providing deep insight into the algorithm's core mechanics. Second, the same problem is solved using the industry-standard scikit-learn library. This dual approach showcases both a strong theoretical foundation in machine learning and practical proficiency with essential data science tools.

## Classification Practice 

This project uses machine learning to predict the initial spread index (ISI) of forest fires in Algeria based on environmental and weather-related features. By analyzing conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and fire weather indices, the model identifies the most influential factors affecting forest fire intensity.

## Stroke Predictor 
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for stroke prediction. It covers data preprocessing, categorical encoding, balancing, training, evaluation, and visualization. The final model effectively predicts stroke cases with very high accuracy and highlights the most influential health and demographic factors. This approach can serve as a foundation for developing predictive healthcare tools and early intervention systems.

## Flight Predictor 
Applied KMeans clustering to ~2,800 product sales records using features like quantity ordered, price each, and total sales. Preprocessed the data with scaling, used the Elbow Method to select the number of clusters, and identified five distinct purchasing patterns. Extracted and interpreted cluster centroids to uncover insights such as bulk low-cost orders versus high-value purchases. Tools: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Yellowbrick.
