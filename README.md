# üè† Smart Home Intelligent System

A beginner-friendly intelligent system for managing smart home devices with automation capabilities.

## Features

- **Device Management**: Control various smart home devices (lights, thermostats, sensors)
- **Intelligent Automation**: Rule-based automation system with time and sensor triggers
- **Web Interface**: Beautiful, responsive web dashboard for device control
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live sensor data simulation and device status updates
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new device types and automation rules

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd smart-home
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the System

#### Option 1: Command Line Interface
```bash
python smart_home.py
```

This will start the system with a simple command-line interface where you can:
- View all devices
- Control individual devices
- Monitor system status
- Save configuration

#### Option 2: Web Interface (Recommended)
```bash
python web_interface.py
```

Then open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

The web interface provides:
- Real-time device dashboard
- Interactive device controls
- System status monitoring
- Automation rule overview

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SmartDevice**: Base class for all smart home devices
2. **SmartLight**: Light devices with brightness and color control
3. **SmartThermostat**: Temperature control devices
4. **SmartSensor**: Environmental monitoring sensors
5. **AutomationRule**: Intelligence system for automated actions
6. **SmartHomeSystem**: Main controller managing all components

### Pre-configured Devices

The system comes with sample devices:
- Living Room Light (controllable brightness)
- Bedroom Light
- Main Thermostat (temperature control)
- Living Room Motion Sensor
- Outdoor Temperature Sensor
- Front Door Sensor

### Pre-configured Automation Rules

1. **Motion Activated Lighting**: Turns on living room light when motion detected
2. **Evening Lighting**: Automatically turns on lights at 6:00 PM
3. **Night Energy Saving**: Turns off lights at 11:00 PM

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Device (Python Code)

```python
from smart_home import SmartHomeSystem, SmartLight

# Create system instance
smart_home = SmartHomeSystem()

# Add a new light
kitchen_light = SmartLight("light_003", "Kitchen Light")
smart_home.add_device(kitchen_light)

# Control the device
kitchen_light.turn_on()
kitchen_light.set_brightness(75)
```

### Creating Custom Automation Rules

```python
from smart_home import AutomationRule

# Create a custom rule
energy_saving_rule = AutomationRule(
    "rule_004",
    "Temperature-based Lighting",
    {
        'type': 'sensor_threshold',
        'device_id': 'sensor_002',  # Temperature sensor
        'threshold': 25,
        'operator': '>'
    },
    {
        'type': 'turn_off',
        'device_id': 'light_001'  # Turn off light when hot
    }
)

# Add rule to system
smart_home.add_automation_rule(energy_saving_rule)
```

## API Endpoints (Web Interface)

- `GET /api/devices` - Get all devices
- `POST /api/devices/<id>/toggle` - Toggle device on/off
- `POST /api/devices/<id>/brightness` - Set light brightness
- `POST /api/devices/<id>/temperature` - Set thermostat temperature
- `GET /api/system/status` - Get system status
- `POST /api/automation/start` - Start automation
- `POST /api/automation/stop` - Stop automation
- `GET /api/rules` - Get automation rules

## Configuration

The system automatically saves configuration to `smart_home_config.json`. This includes:
- Device settings and properties
- Automation rules
- System preferences

## Extending the System

### Adding New Device Types

1. Create a new class inheriting from `SmartDevice`
2. Implement device-specific methods
3. Add to the system using `add_device()`

### Adding New Automation Conditions

Extend the `check_condition()` method in `AutomationRule` class to support new condition types.

### Adding New Actions

Extend the `execute_action()` method in `AutomationRule` class to support new action types.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 5000 already in use**: Change the port in `web_interface.py`
2. **Module not found**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Permission errors**: Make sure Python has write permissions for configuration files

### Logging

The system uses Python's logging module. Logs include:
- Device state changes
- Automation rule triggers
- System status updates
- Error messages

## Learning Resources

This project demonstrates several programming concepts:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Threading for concurrent operations
- REST API design with Flask
- Real-time web interfaces
- JSON data handling
- Logging and error handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for learning:
- Database integration for persistent storage
- User authentication and authorization
- Mobile app interface
- Voice control integration
- Machine learning for predictive automation
- Integration with real IoT devices
- Energy usage monitoring
- Security features (cameras, alarms)
